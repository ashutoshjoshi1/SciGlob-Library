 ,Question,HW part,Description,Correct answer if not standard,Error Answer
"Notes: * stands for a number
Standard answer without error for question without ? is always HW part + 0 + \n, e.g. question <F1r\n> returns <F10\n> (otherwise see column E)
Standard answer without error for question with ? is always HW part + ! + * + \n, e.g. question <F1o?\n> may return  <F1!142\n> (otherwise see column E)
Standard answer with error is always HW part + error index + \n, e.g. question <F1r\n> may return <F11\n>; error index can be 1, 2, 3, etc.",,,,,
